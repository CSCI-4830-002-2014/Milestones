# Milestone Template

## Which Project?
This will be the team's github page, but I haven't yet put my code up there. I'll update this today with another URL to a repo with code for the visualization

## Milestone Number
1

## Who Worked on this submission?
* Irfan Nadiadi

## Describe what you're submitting
I've found a really good [D3 Word Cloud generator](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud), and I have it working locally. I'm trying to adapt it now to support AJAX requests to get data, but I've run into some CORS problems. It shouldn't take too long to fix, I just need to tinker with it a little more.

## Code and Screenshots
Will update this afternoon with code/screenshots. I need to consolidate all the files into a repo.
