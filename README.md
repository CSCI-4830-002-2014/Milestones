## Describe what you're submitting

Milestone 1: Basic Mockup
Jake White and I (Mike Fyk) met to discuss visualizing people coming into the room. We decided that we would use circles to represent the number of people in the room. As the number of people increases, the hue of the circles changes from purple (low wavelength) to red (high wavelength), the size of the circles gets smaller, and the circles move faster. We found a great example with paper.js that displays circles with impressive collisions and allows us to control the size, speed, and color of the circles and we can write functions to update these values from the data. We are also considering overlaying text, estimating when the room is most likely to get less/more crowded, and showing past data/forecasted data below the visualization depending on our ability to implement these features. We have attached screenshots of the visualizations we made below.

Milestone 2: Grid and Data Features
I (Mike Fyk) drew lines on the canvas element and inserted text that can be used to display the count for previous hours and forecast the count for upcoming hours based on previous data. I made the number of people a single variable and made equations for the hue, speed, size of the balls to update the circles correctly based on the number of people. Currently the page updates every ten seconds with new random values for the number of balls as well as the forecasts and past data.
